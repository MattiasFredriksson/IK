# IK
Lean algorithms for solving the inverse kinematics problems using numerical optimization and Numpy.

There are two parts to this project. First part consist of the algorithm implementation maintained in the root directory of the repo. Second part consist of the [documentation](https://github.com/MattiasFredriksson/IK/blob/master/docs/on%20the%20understanding%20of%20rotation%20and%20inverse%20kinematics.pdf) used to summarize the relevant mathemathical concepts, including pseudocode over the implementated algorithms. Since the document covers topics regarding both rotations and rigid body systems, a shorter document is available which only covers the pseudocode for the implemented [algorithms](https://github.com/MattiasFredriksson/IK/blob/master/docs/algorithms.pdf).
