# IK
Lean algorithms for solving the inverse kinematics problems using numerical optimization and Numpy.

There are two parts to this project. First part consist of the implemented algorithms maintained in the root directory of the repo. Second part consist of [documentation](https://github.com/MattiasFredriksson/IK/blob/master/docs/on%20the%20understanding%20of%20rotation%20and%20inverse%20kinematics.pdf) used to summarize the relevant mathemathical concepts, ending with pseudocode over the implemented algorithms. Since the document dedicates multiple sections to discussing math behind rotations and rigid body systems, a shorter document is also available which only covers the [algorithm pseudocode](https://github.com/MattiasFredriksson/IK/blob/master/docs/algorithms.pdf).
