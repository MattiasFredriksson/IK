# IK
Lean algorithms for solving the inverse kinematics problems using numerical optimization and Numpy.

There are two parts to this project. First is a full documentation over the mathematics involved, including sections of pseudocode for the implementations. As the document covers topics regarding both rotations and rigid body systems, a second document is also available only containing pseudocode for the algorithms.
